    <h2>All About Us!</h2>
    <p>You Pet'cha was founded by a pet lover for pet lovers! We want to ensure
    that with everything you have on your plate, you can trust knowing that
    when you need us to, we'll fill you pets' plate. We are based in the area
    of Trinity, FL, USA. We can do pet-sitting in homes within 15 miles, or we
    can board your pet here so long as you transport them to us. Kat Smith is
    our proud business owner, and she takes the care of animals seriously. Kat
    has had pets since the age of 7 and she has always taken the time to properly
    research and care for them, even at a young age. She has owned, and is therefore
    well versed in the care of dogs, cats, birds, hamsters, and fish. Kat takes pride
    in her small animal knowledge, as not many services offer knowledgable care on them.
    We offer a free meet and greet with us so we can get to know you and your animal
    companion while we work out the plan that's best for you! Head on over to our
    pricing page to see more details, or our review page to see what your fellow
    paw-rents have to say!</p>
