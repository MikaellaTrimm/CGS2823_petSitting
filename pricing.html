    <h2>You Pet'cha! Pricing Information</h2>
    <p>On this page you will find the appropriate information on our pricing.
    If you are new to our business we'd like you to be aware that a meet and greet
    is mandatory before we may begin any pet sitting plan for you and your pet.
    This innitial meet and greet is free of charge. Even if you are an existing
    member of our family we still require a meet and greet for all new additions
    that you'll require care for. Caged Animals are birds, hamsters, guinea pigs,
    bunnies, mice. If they are a free-roaming animal of these kinds, the caged animal
    category will still apply to them. PLEASE NOTE: These prices apply if you have 2
    or fewer dogs/cats or 3 or fewer of the caged animals/cats & dogs mixed. If you have
    more animals than this, a special pricing/time schedule will be discussed.
    All care will be taken care of during the time period, which is why we will need
    to discuss which time will be appropriate for your animals needed care.
    walks, feeding, playtime, free-roaming time, etc are all a part of care.</p>
